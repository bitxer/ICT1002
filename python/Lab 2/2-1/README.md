# 2-1: Average Calculator
## Task Description
You are going to design one program to check the popular characters in a given string. You need to write one program to calculate the top 5 most frequent characters.

## Requirements
1.  String has a cool function that you can use to return a copy of the string in which all case-based characters have been lowercased
2.  To get **the top 5 most frequent characters after sorting them**, you need to extract all the characters first and figure out one way to calculate the frequency of each character. Then select the top 5 characters.
> For all the above tasks, please test your program using different input and make sure to document your code properly. Even though the functions will only be introduced next week, you are welcome to use functions to write the program if you know how to use them.

## Example
**Output**: Print out the top 5 characters and their counts in the screen. (Your output should be in one line)
