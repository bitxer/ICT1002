# 2-3: Leap Year Calculator
## Task Description
We develop one program to compute all the leap years between one time period. User will input the start year and the end year. Your task is to figure out how many leap years included within this time period and print out these leap years

## Requirements
1.  **Input**: Two numbers (one is the start year and another is the end year)
2.  **Output**: The number of leap years and all the leap years (Your output should be in one line)
3.  A year is called a leap year, if the year is perfectly divisible by 4 - except for years which are both divisible by 100 and not divisible by 400. The second part of the rule effects century years. For example; the century years 1600 and 2000 are leap years, but the century years 1700, 1800, and 1900 are not. This means that three times out of every 400 years there are 8 years between leap years. More information about the leap years rule can be found online.

## Example
```
$ python2 LeapYearCalculator.py 1989 2000
The number of Leap Years is 3, the Leap Years are 1992, 1996, 2000
