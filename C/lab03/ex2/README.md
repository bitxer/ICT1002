# Exercise 2: Pointer, Arrays and Functions
## Task Description
Write functions that perform each of the following tasks, using the given function prototype. In each case, you may assume that the destination array is large enough to hold the data to be put into it.
## Requirements
1. Copy the contents of the array src (of length n) to the array dest:
```
void acopy(int *dest, const int *src, int n)
```
2. Compare the contents of two arrays of length n, returning 1 if the two arrays contain the same elements in the same order and 0 otherwise:
```
int acmp(const int *a1, const int *a2, int n)
```
