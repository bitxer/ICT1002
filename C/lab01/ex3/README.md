# Exercise 3: Reading Input and Performing Calculations
## Task Description
The Body Mass Index (BMI) is calculated as follow:
'''
BMI = weightInKilograms/(heightInMeters^2)
'''
## Requirements
Create a new program called “bmi” that asks the user to type in his or her weight in kilograms and
height in metres, then calculates and displays the user’s BMI to one decimal place. The application
should also evaluate whether the user is underweight or overweight according to the following
table:
| BMI         | Evaluation  |
|:-----------:|:-----------:|
| < 18.5      | Underweight |
| 18.5 - 24.9 | Normal      |
| 25.0 - 29.9 | Overweight  |
| > 29.9      | Obese       |

## Example
```
Enter your weight in kilograms: 65
Enter your height in metres: 1.85
Your BMI is 19.0. That is within the normal range.
