# Exercise 2: C Expressions
## Task Description
Suppose that the following variable declarations have been made in a program
```
int a = ‐1, b = 2;
float x = 0.1;
float y = 1.5;
char c = 'p';
```
## Requirements
1. Write a program to print the value for each of the following calculation to the screen.
    1. `a / b`
    2. `a * b`
    3. `(b * 3) % 4`
    4. `x * a`
    5. `x * y`
    6. `y / x`
    7. `c – 3`
2. Write a program to print the results.
    1. `printf("%4d", a);`
    2. `printf("%04d", b);`
    3. `printf("a/b = %d", a / b);`
    4. `printf("%x", b);`
    5. `printf("%.2f", y);`
    6. `printf("%10.1f", x);`
    7. `printf("c =\t%c", c);`
