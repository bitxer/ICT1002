# 1-1: Average Calculator
## Task Description
Develop a simple average calculator program

## Requirements
1.  Allow users to run your program with three input arguments by passing three values to the program: a, b and c.
2.  Your program will read the three arguments and calculate the average value.
3.  After user inputs all the numbers, if the input numbers are invalid, you need to present an error message “Your input is invalid!”. Otherwise, you need to print out the average value. The output average value requires to have 2 precisions. For instance, if the value is 23.456, it should print 23.45. If it is 23, it should print 23.00.
> NOTE: You have to strictly follow the input and output format.

## Example
```
$ python2 AverageCalculator.py 3 4 5
Average:4.00
$ python2 AverageCalculator.py 60 39 92
Average:63.67
$ python2 AverageCalculator.py abc 10 20
Your input is invalid!
