# 3-2: Counting Letters
## Task Description
In this task you will write a program that reads two sequences of numbers. The first sequence of numbers is called candidate and the second sequence of numbers is called pattern. Your program will determine if the pattern is found entirely in the candidate. To be considered found entirely, all elements of pattern must be in the candidate sequence at consecutive positions. You have to output the number of founded patterns, or -1 if the pattern is not found in the candidate.

## Requirements
### Input
Allow the users to input two sequences, the first sequence is the candidate and the second candidate is the pattern.

### Output
The number of pattern sequence appearing in the candidate sequence (in ONE line).

## Example
```
$ python2 PatternSearching.py 1,2,3,1,2 1,2
Pattern appears 2 time!
```
